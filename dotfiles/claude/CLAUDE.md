- skip unnecessary comments, add them only if really necessary
- keep code consistent with the patterns in the codebase, for example naming, using `interface` vs `type`, etc.
- prefer discriminated unions over optional fields; make illegal states unrepresentable
- for running shell commands you have access to nix-comma: `, something` (for example: `, pdfinfo [...]`); prefer it over trying to do ad-hoc code
- if writing ad-hoc code, use `node` instead of `python`
- use `trash` command instead of `rm` on macOS
- use web search if you are unsure about anything, especially in the planning stages - look for documentation, recent online GitHub issues, etc.
- when struggling to understand a library, just git clone it into `/tmp/` and review the code there
- when running in `tmux`, other pane contents are captured to `/tmp/tmux-panes-$TMUX_PANE.txt` before each prompt
  - always run `echo $TMUX_PANE` first to get the actual pane ID, never guess it
  - read the file when you need to see adjacent panes, use `capture-pane` for more context
  - send commands to these panes with `tmux send-keys -t <pane_id> 'command' Enter`
  - for testing commands depending on the environment, running things requiring `sudo` etc. feel free to create new splits - wait for `zsh` to appear, and then run the command in there
