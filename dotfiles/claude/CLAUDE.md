- skip unnecessary comments, add them only if really necessary
- keep code consistent with the patterns in the codebase, for example naming, using `interface` vs `type`, etc.
- prefer discriminated unions over optional fields; make illegal states unrepresentable
- for running shell commands you have access to nix-comma: `, something` (for example: `, pdfinfo [...]`); prefer it over trying to do ad-hoc code
- if writing ad-hoc code, use `node` instead of `python`
- use `trash` command instead of `rm`
- use web search if you are unsure about anything, especially in the planning stages - look for documentation, recent online GitHub issues, etc.
- when struggling to understand a library, just git clone it into `/tmp/` and review the code there
